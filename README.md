# Weather Type Classification using KNIME

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **weather type classification and temperature prediction** using **KNIME Analytics Platform**.  
The dataset is **synthetically generated weather data** designed for practicing machine learning, preprocessing, and outlier detection techniques.

Multiple **predictive algorithms** were implemented and compared to classify weather into:
- 🌧️ Rainy  
- ☀️ Sunny  
- ☁️ Cloudy  
- ❄️ Snowy
